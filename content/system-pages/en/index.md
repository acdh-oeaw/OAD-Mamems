  Mediterranean Society: Contextualizing the History of a Monastic Republic (ca.
  850-1550)" (MAMEMS) project, funded by a Starting Grant of the European
  Research Council and hosted first at the Johannes Gutenberg University of
  Mainz (2020-2024) and now at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (from
  2024). MAMEMS constitutes the first comprehensive examination of the monastic
  communities of Mount Athos as independent actors in medieval Eastern
  Mediterranean society.'

THANADOS (The Anthropological and Archaeological Database of Sepultures) deals with the digital
collection and presentation of Early Medieval cemeteries in the area of present day Austria.

Within THANADOS hitherto published information on Early Medieval burials was digitized and
translated to English language. The data are mapped using the CIDOC CRM and provided online. The
information can be explored via a digital catalogue and within an interactive map. Cartographic
visualisations as well as charts and plots are created dynamically based on real archaeological
research data.

It aims at providing a best practice way on how to disseminate archaeological sources and research
in the 21st century against the background of digital humanities.
