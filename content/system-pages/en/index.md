leadIn: 'Welcome to the website of the "Mount Athos in Medieval Eastern
  Mediterranean Society: Contextualizing the History of a Monastic Republic (ca.
  850-1550)" (MAMEMS) project, funded by a Starting Grant of the European
  Research Council and hosted first at the Johannes Gutenberg University of
  Mainz (2020-2024) and now at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (from
  2024). MAMEMS constitutes the first comprehensive examination of the monastic
  communities of Mount Athos as independent actors in medieval Eastern
  Mediterranean society.'
